                        <p>Media queries are most commonly used to adjust styles based on the width
                             or height of the viewport (the visible area of the browser). You can set
                             styles for specific screen widths, like making text smaller on narrow 
                             screens or changing layouts on wider screens. You can check for minimum 
                             or maximum width/height, which is useful for building responsive designs 
                             that adapt to mobile phones, tablets, and desktops.</p>

                        <img src="media/skill2.jpeg" alt="">
                        <p>While similar to viewport dimensions, these features refer to the full dimensions of the device’s screen, even if the browser is resized to be smaller. This was more common in older responsive design approaches when developers targeted specific devices directly, but today it’s less used since viewport-based queries are more flexible.</p>

                        <p>Aspect ratio refers to the proportion between a screen’s width and height. Media queries can adjust layouts depending on whether the screen is wide (like a TV) or tall (like a phone). This is useful when designing elements for displays like ultrawide monitors or devices that don’t fit typical width/height patterns.</p>
